<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## PhoneFix.ai

For this Hackathon project, we decided to solve a very annoying problem that occurs when trying to set an image as your phone wallpaper. When setting a image as a wallpaper, we sometimes come to the issue where that image's asepct ratio is unsuitable for a phone wallpaper, causing the need to cut and stretch the image, potentially loosing parts of the image and ruining the wallpaper. However PhoneFix.ai is able to take this image and use ChatGpt's Dalle-2 image generation and genereate new sections of your image so that its able to fit on a phone screen without the need to stretch, cut or leave horrendous black bars on the image.
